# TODO 12/23/30

1. I need to figure out a way to uniquely identify each piece 
- we could assign each piece a `start_position_id` since that will be unique per piece.
- this will be used to coordinate the copies of pieces on the board and the pieces which belong to a given player.
[done]

2. figure out how to handle unbounded movements 

3. Finish instantiating the board with the pieces 

4. Should I assign each cell in the board with a notation (e.g. a1)?
- maybe I could keep a separate structure that just has this info to make things less complicated.

5.
