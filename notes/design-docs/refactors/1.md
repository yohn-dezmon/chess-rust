# Instead of having separate structs for chess pieces

let's just have a single chess piece struct.  
Then add a field that says "piece type", which can be "pawn, rook, etc.".


Ok counter argument though:
- although points, and position operate the same for all chess piece,
allowed movements (which we can denote as an array of (x,y) transformations), will be distinct for each chess piece DEPENDENT upon its type.   


# PROPOSED SOLUTION

Use an enum for `PieceType`

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum PieceType {
    Pawn,
    Knight,
    Bishop,
    Rook,
    Queen,
    King,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct ChessPiece {
    piece_type: PieceType,
    color: Color,
    position_xy: Vec<i32>,
    position_text: String,

}
```
