# BlackPieces

- struct
- has an impl (constructor) block where we assign each 
    - pawn
    - rook
    - bishop
    - knight
    - king
    - queen
- their respective coordinates (x,y) and e.g. "a1"
    - x,y is called `position_xy`
    - the other one is `position_text`


question: 
- Do I really need to assign them their coordinates upon instantiation, or should that just be handled by the board itself?
