How do I implement a struct with one default value but leave the other fields uninitiated?

For example here is my Pawn struct, I only want to have points have a default value but the other fields will be different for each pawn that is instantiated later in the code.


```
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Pawn {
    points: i32,
    position_xy: Vec<i32>,
    position_text: String,
}

impl Pawn {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // set default value to 1 for Pawn
        Pawn { points: 1 }
    }
}
```


SOLUTION:
- just implement them with default values. E.g. an empty vec or an empty string! :D
