# Type vs Struct in rust?

```rust
pub type ChessBoard = Vec<Vec<SquareContent>>;
```

type here is not defining a new kind of type, it's just a "type alias". It's just giving an additional name
to an existing type. 

Inside of an impl block, `type Foo = ...;` is an "associated type". Mostly used in traits. Also a kind of type alias because you're not defining a new type, but you're specifying a type the trait will produce/interact with.

Structs create new types.
