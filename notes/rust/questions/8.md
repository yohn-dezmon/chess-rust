# if I'm instantiating a class in rust, and I'm going to modify its fields. Does the class also have to be `mut`?

In Rust, the concept of mutability applies to variables and references, not directly to structs or classes. When you create an instance of a struct, whether you can modify its fields depends on the mutability of the fields themselves.
