# Should I always do Debug for all structs in Rust?

```
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
```

^ attribute macro.  
or "derive debug statement"


# If I have an enum composed of various structs, do I put the Debug derive statement above the enum and each struct or just above the enum?

you can just put it above the enum!
