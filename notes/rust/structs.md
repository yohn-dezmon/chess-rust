The pieces of data in a struct are called **fields**.  


# Encapsulation 

In rust it's a best practice to provide methods to access struct fields.  
Even if a method just returns the field value, you should still have a method.  

# Default values 

Rust does not provide a built-in way to set default values for struct fields directly in the struct definition.
